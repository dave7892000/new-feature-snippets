# new-feature-snippets
This repo contains snippets of code showcasing a new feature I just built.  The owner of this website wanted an internal file sharing system for himself, his lead engineer, and office administrator.  This was entirely green space, I built this from scratch. 
Each file here is a copy/paste from my real-world feature update. Some of the files here will be a combination of files. For instance, I have 4 migrations in the real feature, I'll include them all in one file here.
